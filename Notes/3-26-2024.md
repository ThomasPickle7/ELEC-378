## Beyond Linear Separability
- **Linear Separability**: The process of separating data points into two classes using a straignt line.
    - **Example**: In a 2D plane, a straight line can separate the data points into two classes.
    - Real world scenarios in high dimensions or complex data, data points are not linearly separable.
- **Non-Linear Separability**: The process of separating data points into two classes using a non-linear boundary.
    - **Example**: In a 2D plane, a circle can separate the data points into two classes.
    - **Example**: In a 3D plane, a sphere can separate the data points into two classes.
